# About rust-playground
This repo is my personal Sandbox for learning rust. It consists of a few small projects that I use to learn new concepts and try out new things. Feel free to use it as a reference for your own projects or test out my tools. I would love to hear your feedback! If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or contact me on [linkedin](github.com/juweins/juweins).

# Projects
## car-manufaturer
This project is a simple car manufacturer that can be used to create cars and print them to the console. It is a simple project that I used to learn about structs and enums in rust. The project originates from Microsoft's [Learn Rust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/rust-get-started/) course.

## server
This project is a first implementation of an HTTP server that can be used to learn about the specific flavors of rust. It is a intermediate project that originates from the amazing udemy course of "Learn Rust by Building Real Applications" by [Lyubomir Gavadinov](https://github.com/gavadinov/Learn-Rust-by-Building-Real-Applications) and contains my history. I will contiously improve this project and add new features to it. Check out the repositories README.md for more information.

You can try this project by following the installation instructions or using the linked docker image from my Dockerhub!

## grrs
This project is a simple grep implementation that I used to learn about the standard library and error handling in rust. It is a handy CLI-tool project that I used to learn about utilizing CLI specific crates in rust. The project idea originates from the official rust book. Check out the repositories README.md for more information! I will contiously improve this project and add new features to it.
