# About this Project
This project is a simple implementation of the official Tokio tutorial. It is a simple TCP echo server that can be used to test the Tokio library.

The code is written in Rust and uses the Tokio library. The code is not mine, it is (by now) the official Tokio tutorial code which can be found here: https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/hello-world/ . The code is licensed under the MIT license.

The git history contains my progress while coding along with the tutorial. As with all of my rust projects, I plan to extend the code with my own ideas and features to learn more about the language and the Tokio library!
